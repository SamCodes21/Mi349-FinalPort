      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Samuel Doerr and I’m currently an undergraduate in the Games and Interactive Media department at Michigan State University. I was born and raised in Michigan, growing up in Traverse City.  From a young age I’ve always enjoyed games, whether it be playing games with my brother or spending some time unwinding on my own, games have always been an important part of my life. However, games are more than just a means of entertainment for me. They’ve helped bring some light to dark times in my life, and some of the most inspiring tales I’ve experienced have come from games. By pursuing a career in the games industry, I want to help create an experience that inspires others, helping them through some of the low points in life, just as games have for me.

      <h2>Skill-sets and Passions:</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, I am certified in basic web development using HTML and CSS as well as being certified in Python on Certiport. I obtained both of those certificates from Northwestern Michigan Community where I also got my associates degree. At the moment, I’ve been learning C# for game development at MSU. Outside of class I’ve had an interest in learning to draw, using Procreate and Krita to learn. Additionally, I’ve dabbled some in Blender and plan to fully learn it in the near future, using Blender to make 3D levels for future game projects.
